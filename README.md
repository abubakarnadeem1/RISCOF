# RISCOF
# Introduction

**RISCOF** (RISC-V Compliance Framework) is a tool designed to make sure that processors based on the RISC-V ISA work correctly and follow the rules set by RISC-V. Think of it like a quality check for RISC-V processors, ensuring they are reliable and perform as expected.

## Importance

By running tests through RISCOF, developers can verify that their processors fully comply with the official RISC-V standards. It helps to catch any mistakes early, saving time and ensuring that devices powered by these processors will be reliable.


## Working

**Inputs to RISCOF**:

1.  A **YAML specification** based on RISCV-CONFIG, detailing the ISA choices.
2.  A **Python plugin** to handle test compilation, simulation, and signature extraction.

**External Dependencies**:

-   **RISCV-CONFIG** validates the YAML file and checks for compliance with RISC-V specs.
-   **RISCV-ISAC** helps assess the quality and coverage of the test suite.

**Internal Components**:

-   **DBGEN** maintains a database of all architectural tests and generates YAML files for relevant tests.
-   **Test Selector** filters applicable tests based on the YAML specification and presents them in a test list.

**Execution Flow**:

-   The user provides the YAML spec and Python plugin.
-   The YAML is validated and standardized by RISCV-CONFIG.
-   The Test Selector chooses relevant tests based on the configuration.
-   Tests are executed on both the userâ€™s model and a reference model, and their results (signatures) are compared.
-   If the signatures match, the test is passed. An HTML report is generated to show test results.

## Installation steps for RISCOF

To use **RISCOF**, you'll need to install Python 3, update your pip (Python package manager), and install RISCOF. Below are the step-by-step commands and what they do:

1.  **Install Python 3:**
    
    `sudo apt-get install python3`

### Handling Common Installation Error

Sometimes, during the installation, you may encounter this error:


ERROR: riscv-config 3.18.3 has requirement pyyaml==5.2, 

This means that RISCOF requires a specific version of **pyyaml** (a Python package) but you have a different version installed.

To fix this, run the following command:


`pip install pyyaml==5.2` 

This installs the correct version of **pyyaml** (version 5.2). After that, you can rerun the RISCOF installation:


`pip3 install -U riscof`

## Testing RISCOF

Once you have installed RISCOF you can execute `riscof  --help` to print the help routine, it will show the output like this.

# Installing Plugin Models

SAIL and Spike are the two reference models that are used as reference models in RISCOF. We will go through its installation steps.

## SAIL

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    

    
    `sudo apt-get install opam build-essential libgmp-dev z3 pkg-config zlib1g-dev` 
    
    This command installs essential tools and libraries:
    
    -   **Opam**: A package manager for OCaml, which Sail is written in.
    -   **build-essential**: Includes the compiler and other tools needed to compile software.
    -   **libgmp-dev**: A library for arithmetic operations (used by Sail).
    -   **z3**: A theorem prover used by Sail for formal verification.
    -   **pkg-config** and **zlib1g-dev**: Libraries for handling dependencies.

2.  **Initialize OPAM:**
   
    
    `opam init -y --disable-sandboxing` 
    
    This initializes **OPAM**, the OCaml package manager, to install OCaml packages. The `--disable-sandboxing` option avoids permission issues during installation.

3.  **Install Sail:**
  
    
    `opam install sail -y` 
    
    This installs the **Sail** package from OPAM, which provides the Sail RISC-V specification.

4.  **Set the environment:**
    
   
    
    `eval $(opam env)` 
    
    This command configures your shell environment to use the installed OPAM packages. It makes sure Sail and other installed tools are available in your current session.
    
5.  **Clone the Sail RISC-V repository:**
    
    
    
    `git clone https://github.com/riscv/sail-riscv.git` 
    
    This clones the official **Sail RISC-V** repository from GitHub, which contains the RISC-V models and emulators.
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/257036b3-6823-4f1b-86da-584791251c83)

    
7.  **Build the RISC-V models for 32-bit and 64-bit architectures:**
    
   
    
    cd sail-riscv
    
    ARCH=RV32 make
    
    ARCH=RV64 make
    
    These commands build the **RV32** (32-bit) and **RV64** (64-bit) RISC-V architecture models using the Sail tool. The `make` command compiles the source code into an executable emulator.
    
9.  **Create symbolic links for the emulators:**
 
    
    `sudo ln -s sail-riscv/c_emulator/riscv_sim_RV64 /usr/bin/riscv_sim_RV64
    sudo ln -s sail-riscv/c_emulator/riscv_sim_RV32 /usr/bin/riscv_sim_RV32` 
    
    These commands create shortcuts (symbolic links) in `/usr/bin` so you can easily run the RISC-V simulators from any directory. By doing this, you can just type `riscv_sim_RV64` or `riscv_sim_RV32` to launch the respective simulator.
    
10.  **Update the PATH:**
    
   
    
    `export PATH=~/sail-riscv/c_emulator:$PATH` 
    
    This adds the Sail RISC-V emulator directory to your system's `PATH`. It ensures that the system can find and run the emulator from any location. 	This path is to be added in the bashrc file using "nano ~/.bashrc".

## SPIKE

1.  **Install the Device Tree Compiler:**
    
    `sudo apt-get install device-tree-compiler` 
    
    This command installs the **Device Tree Compiler**. This tool is required by many RISC-V projects, including the ISA simulator, as it helps manage hardware configuration information.
    
2.  **Clone the RISC-V ISA Simulator Repository:**
    
    
    
    `git clone https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-isa-sim.git` 
    
    This downloads the **riscv-isa-sim** repository from GitHub, which contains the Spike simulator source code. Spike is the official RISC-V ISA simulator used to run and debug RISC-V binaries. If cloning shows an error "fatal : early EOF", then clone it again.
    
3.  **Navigate to the Project Directory and Create a Build Folder:**
    
    cd riscv-isa-sim
    
    mkdir build
    
    cd build
    
    Here, you navigate into the cloned repository folder (`riscv-isa-sim`) and create a **build directory** where the compiled code will be stored. The `build` directory helps keep the source code separate from the compiled files.
    
5.  **Configure the Build Environment:**

    
    `../configure --prefix=$RISCV` 
    
    This command configures the build system for the RISC-V ISA simulator. The `--prefix=$RISCV` option tells the build system where to install the simulator binaries. You need to have `$RISCV` environment variable set up beforehand (pointing to your preferred installation directory).
    
6.  **Compile the Simulator:**
    
  
    
    `make` 
    
    This command compiles the simulator using the build instructions created during the configuration step. It turns the source code into executable binaries.
    
7.  **Install the Simulator:**
    
   
    
    `make install` 
    
    This installs the compiled simulator binaries to the directory specified by `$RISCV`. After this step, the Spike simulator will be available for use, allowing you to simulate and test RISC-V programs.
8.  **Confirming the installation**
    
    `spike` 
    Write spike on the terminal to check whether it shows the same output.

## Installation of Verilator
For correct working of RISCOF, verilator needs to be installed too by the command.

`sudo apt install verilator`

To check that Verilator was installed correctly by running:

`verilator --version`

## Testing RISCOF on UETRV-PCore-main

   First of all, we need to clone UETRV-PCore-main from git using the command
   git clone https://github.com/ee-uet/UETRV-PCore.git
   Then, change your directory by using the command
   
   `cd UETRV-PCore`
   
   Then, change your directory to verif by using the command
   
   `cd verif`
   
   Then, clone the repository from git using the command
   
   `git clone https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-arch-test.git`
   
   Make sure it is cloned correctly.
   After this, we will open the readme file from verif folder and run the following command from verif directory.
   
`riscof run --config=config.ini \ --suite=riscv-arch-test/riscv-test-suite/ \ --env=riscv-arch-test/riscv-test-suite/env`

If it still shows an error regarding riscv_sim_RV32, make sure the right path is added bashrc file.

It will run the tests defined by ISA string `RV32IM` in pcore_isa.yaml. At the end, RISCOF will generate a report describing the pass/fail status of the tests. `riscof_work` directory will be created containg the report and the artifacts of DUT and Reference model.
